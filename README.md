# Rico [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rico-project/rico.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rico-project/rico)
This repository contains all Java related sources of Rico. Clients for other languages will be provided in seperate repositories (JavaScript, AngularJS, Polymer and Android).

## 🆕🐥🐶 First Timers Support
At Karakun we ❤️ open source. Based on this we develop the complete Rico framework as an open source project. If you are new to open source development we have some specific issues for you. Just have a look at all issues with the 'good first issue' label. This issues are reserved for people who never contributed to Open Source before. We know that the process of creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issues are for you 💝 We use such issues for example to get involved at Hacktoberfest. If you want to know more about open source development and contribution in general you should have a look at this overview.
