== Building Rico

The build of Rico is based on Gradle. Based on the Gradle plugins that we use for the build
we currently rely on Gradle version `6.4-rc-1`. Since the gradle wrapper is used you do not need
to install Gradle on your system. Based on a bug in the `javadoc` executable of
early versions of Java 11 you need Java version `11.0.6` as a minimum version to build rico.
By using older Java 11 releases the build step of the JavaDoc creation will fail. For executing
the integration tests of Rico `docker-compose` (and `docker`) is needed.

A complete build can be started by

....
./gradlew build
....

The build task does not only build all modules. By calling the task the documentation is createdn and all integration
tests will be executed.
