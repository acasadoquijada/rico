=== Provide metrics for monitoring

An application that uses Rico metrics will provide a `/metrics` endpoint by default.
This endpopint provides all metrics information in a format that can be read by https://prometheus.io[prometheus].
Based on this a custom monitoring solution can be created.

==== Using Prometheus

Prometheus is a open source monitoring system and time series database.
A correctly configured Prometheus instance can fetch the metrics of a running application and store them in timeseries.

The easiest way to use Prometheus is by docker.
Prometheus already provides ready-to-use docker containers that fit perfect to Rico metrics.
Only the endpoint of the application or applications must be configured.
To do so we can create a custom configuration for Prometheus in a `prometheus.yml` YAML file:

[source,yml]
----
global:
  scrape_interval:     10s # <1>

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'rico-metrics' # <2>

    metrics_path: '/metrics' # <3>
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['app-server:8080'] # <4>
----
<1> This defines the interval in that Prometheus will fetch metrics records from the server
<2> Name of the internal job that will fetch the data
<3> The endpoint on the server.
Here we use the default `/metrics`
<4> An array of servers.
Prometheus will try to fetch metrics records from each server in this array

Next to this we need to create a Docker file that extends the default Docker image from Prometheus and adds our custom configuration:

[source,docker]
----
FROM prom/prometheus:v2.18.1
MAINTAINER Hendrik Ebbers, karakun.com
ADD prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/
----

Prometheus provides a simple web frontend that can be used to visualize metrics.
Any metric that has been created in a Java application by using the Rico metrics API can be displayed.
Next to the custom metrics of an application Rico already provides some general metrics.

==== Create reuseable dashboards with Grafana

While Prometheus can be used to visualize a graph of 1 metric or query you normally expect much more functionality for modern application monitoring.
Since the data storage and query handlung is the main task of Prometheus an additional tool should be used to visualize all the metrics.
Here https://grafana.com[Grafana] is a very good choose.
The open source tool can be used to create dashboards with several graphs based on data that is available in Prometheus.

.Grafana and Prometheus

The following picture shows a sample dashboard that was created with grafana.
Next to this a live demo can be found https://play.grafana.org/[here].

As already described for Prometheus we can start Grafana in a Docker container, too.
Information about running Grafana in Docker can be found https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/docker/[here].
If you want to automate the configuration and provisioning of Grafana https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/[this link] will be helpfull.
Next to this we provide a https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose] based sample in https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-samples/tree/master/metrics-sample[the Rico samples repository].
