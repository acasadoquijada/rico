=== Architecture overview

When using remoting as part of a client-server-application all models
will automatically be synchronized between client and server.
Thus, you donâ€™t need to think about any specific endpoints or requests.

Based on this, the remoting API defines server side controllers
that contain all the controller logic for a specific view.
The lifecycle of these controllers is automatically synchronized with
the view lifecycle. With this approach you have a MVC group for each
client view with a synchronized model and a managed controller.

The Rico remoting API provides a server and client framework that
let you easily write applications based on the described pattern.
To do so the platform contains support for well known sever frameworks
like JakartaEE or Spring and several implementations to create clients
by using for example JavaFX or Angular.
