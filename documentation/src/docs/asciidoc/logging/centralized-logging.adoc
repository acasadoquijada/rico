=== Centralized logging

A centralized logging infrastructure brings many advantages.
Amongst them are:

* seeing logs from all application hosts in a single location
* configurable UI
* advanced search tools
* stored queries
* alerting on special events

For Greylog and ELK our samples contain a docker-compose based sample setup which are well-proven for development.
In production, you will need to think about user management, persistent storage, and backups.
