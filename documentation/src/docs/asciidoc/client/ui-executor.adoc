=== UI executor in Rico

When using Swing all UI specific operations need to be handled in the EDT (Event dispatch thread) of Swing.
When using JavaFX all UI specific operations must be handled in the JavaFX platform thread.
Rico provides an abstraction of such threads by providing the interface `dev.rico.client.concurrent.UiExecutor`.
The interface extends the basic Java `java.util.concurrent.Executor` interface with some additional helpful methods when working with ui toolkits.
The following code snippet shows how an instance of the UiExecutor can be received an used:

[source,java]
----
UiExecutor uiExecutor = Client.getService(UiExecutor.class); // <1>

uiExecutor.execute(() -> updateUi()); // <2>
----

<1> Here we receive a `UiExecutor` instance.
<2> By using the executor the given runnable will be executed in the ui toolkit thread.
