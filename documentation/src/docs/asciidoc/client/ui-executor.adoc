=== UI executor in Rico

When using Swing all ui specific operations need to be handled in the EDT (Event dispatch thread) that is a swing specific thread.
When using JavaFX all ui specific operations must be handled in the JavaFX platform thread.
Rico provides an abstraction of such thread by providing the `dev.rico.client.concurrent.UiExecutor` interface.
The interface extends the basic Java `java.util.concurrent.Executor` interface with some additional helpfull methods when working with ui toolkits.
The following code snippet shows how an instance of the UiExecutor can be received an used:

[source,java]
----
UiExecutor uiExecutor = Client.getService(UiExecutor.class); // <1>

uiExecutor.execute(() -> updateUi()); // <2>
----

<1> Here we receive a `UiExecutor` instance.
<2> By using the executor the given runnable will be executed in the ui toolkit thread.
