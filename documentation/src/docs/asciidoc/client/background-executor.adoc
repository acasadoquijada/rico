=== Background executor

Rico's executor for the UI toolkit provides a background executor backed by a configurable thread pool.
For most use-cases this executor is the only tool you will need to execute background and async tasks in a java client.
The background executor is defined by the interface `dev.rico.client.concurrent.BackgroundExecutor`.
It extends the basic Java `java.util.concurrent.Executor` interface with some additional helpful methods and functionalities.

The following code snippet shows how use the background executor:

[source,java]
----
BackgroundExecutor backgroundExecutor = Client.getService(BackgroundExecutor.class); // <1>

backgroundExecutor.execute(() -> longRunningTask()); // <2>
----
<1> Here we receive a `BackgroundExecutor` instance.
<2> By using the executor the given runnable will be executed in the background.

Several APIs of Rico like the `Scheduler` or the `TaskChain` are based on the `BackgroundExecutor`.
