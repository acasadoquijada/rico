=== UI toolkit support in Rico

Rico provides serveral APIs that automatically handle UI toolkit specific functionalities like the thread handling.
To benefit from such features the UI toolkit must be specified in Rico.
A UI toolkit is defined by the interface `dev.rico.client.Toolkit` in Rico.
At the moment Rico provides an implementation of that interface for Swing and JavaFX.

The following code shows how the ui toolkit can be configured in Rico:

[source,java]
----
final Toolkit javaFxToolkit = new FxToolkit();
Client.init(javaFxToolkit);
----

For the implemented toolkits Rico provides some convenience methods that make the usage even more easy:

[source,java]
----
FxToolkit.init();
----

Normally this code should be directly in the main method of your client application, since several functionalities of the Rico client API won't be useable without a configured UI toolkit.
