== TaskChain API

The TaskChain API provides an easy way to create a chain of individual tasks.
Between tasks the chain can switch between the ui thread and background threads.

When creating a client application you normally need to implement long running tasks like a server call.
Any long running task should always be executed on a background thread.
If such task is executed on the ui thread no user interaction or repaint / layout of the application can happen will the task is executed.
This will always end in a bad behavior since the application looks like it is frozen and maybe wrong pixel artifacts are rendered on the screen if the application is resized, for example.

A background thread in Java can easily be created and used by using the factory methods in `java.util.concurrent.Executors`.
Much more complexe code is needed if we want to react on the result of a background thread in the ui thread.
This pattern is quite normal in a client.
Let's asume you want to trigger a server endpoint and display the result of the call in the client.
Maybe you even want to show a loading animation in the client while the server call is executed and show an error if an exception happens.
The following diagram gives an overview of the needed task:

By using only basic API such use case will end in a lot of code in Swing or JavaFX.
The following code snippet shows how such workflow can be created in Swing:

[source,java]
----
//We assume that we are already on the ui-Thread

showLoadingAnimation();
backgroundExecutors.execute(() -> {
    try {
        final String result = callServer();
        SwingUtilties.invokeAndWait(() -> updateUi(result));
    } catch(final Exception e) {
       SwingUtilties.invokeLater(() -> showErrorDialog(e));
    } finally {
        SwingUtilties.invokeLater(() -> hideLoadingAnimation(e));
    }
});
----

As you can see this is really a lot of code for a common default workflow that you might need multiple times per application.

The TaskChain API helps you to create better readable and maintainable code for scenarios like the described one.
The TaskChain provides a fluent API that let you define workflows with multiple switches between background threads and the ui thread.
Before we have a deeper look at the API let's see how the given example would look like by using the TaskChain API:

[source,java]
----
UiExecutor.createUiTaskChain()
    .execute(() -> showLoadingAnimation())
    .background()
    .supply(() -> callServer())
    .ui()
    .consume(v -> updateUi(v))
    .onException(e -> showErrorDialog(e))
    .thenFinally(() -> hideLoadingAnimation())
    .run();

The main entry point of the TaskChain API is the `dev.rico.client.concurrent.TaskChain` interface.
New instances should always be created by factory methods that are provided by the `dev.rico.client.concurrent.UiExecutor` interface.

[source,java]
----
final TaskChain chain = UiExecutor.createUiTaskChain();
