== Snapshot releases

Each commit to the master branch will automatically trigger a Travis build.
This build will upload the build artifacts as snapshots to https://oss.jfrog.org[the open snapshot repository from JFrog].
You can find all Rico artifacts https://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/dev/rico/[here].

If you want to depend on snapshot builds of Rico you need to add the maven repository to your build:

[source,xml]
----
<distributionManagement>
    <snapshotRepository>
        <id>snapshots</id>
        <name>oss-jfrog-artifactory-snapshots</name>
        <url>https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
