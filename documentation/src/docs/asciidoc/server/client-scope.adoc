=== Client Scope

Rico supports an additional custom Scope called ClientScope.
This scope is implemented for JavaEE and Spring and it’s defined as a scope that is "lower than the session scope".
This scope is important if you want to create statefull web applications, for example.
Since all the tabs of a browser share the same session it’s hard to define data that is only related to one tab in the browser.
In that case the lifecycle of a client scope is bound to a tab in the browser and ends when the tab will be closed.

For both JavaEE and Spring a `dev.rico.server.javaee.ClientScoped` annotation is defined that can be used to give any bean the specific scope:

[source,java]
----
@ClientScoped
public class MyLocalStoreService {

    private List<String> values = new ArrayList();

    public void add(String val) {
        values.add(val);
    }

}
----

Internally the client scope is defined by an unique identifier that is shared between client and server with each request.
Based on this the scope only "lives" inside a http request roundtrip.

Rico provides a `dev.rico.server.client.ClientSessionListener` interface that behaves similar to the `javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionListener` listener.
By using the `dev.rico.server.ServerListener` annotation client scope listeners will automatically be found and registered at the server bootstrap.
The following code shows an example for such listener:

[source,java]
----
@ServerListener
public class MyClientSessionListener implements ClientSessionListener {

    public void sessionCreated(ClientSession clientSession) {
        String clientSessionId = clientSession.getId();
        String httpSessionId = clientSession.getHttpSession().getId();
        System.out.println("Client session '" + clientSessionId  + "' created in http session '" + httpSessionId + "'");
    }
    public void sessionDestroyed(ClientSession clientSession) {
        final String clientSessionId = clientSession.getId();
        System.out.println("Client session '" + clientSessionId  + "' destroyed");
    }

}
