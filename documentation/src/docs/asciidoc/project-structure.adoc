for the build that will create a jar per module. Next to this each module is defined
as a Java module.

Rico contains several projects that are in incubation state. All such projects
are located in the incubation folder. Next to this Rico contains several projects
that are only needed for internal unit and integration tests
(see folder integration-tests). All this modules must not follow all the rules and
structure that is defined here.

=== Gradle build

TODO
- build.gradle defines everything

=== Gradle modules

All gradle modules are defined in the `settings.gradle` file that is located in
the root folder of the project.

Next to this each project provides it own gradle file. Such file must have the
same name as the gradle module (based on the common code in `settings.gradle`).
The gradle file for the `rico-client` module must be named `rico-client.gradle`.
Each of this gradle files defines the dependencies of a module (for the gradle build).
