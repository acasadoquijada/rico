== Best practices for documentation

This chapter contains some best practices that Rico commiters should have a look
at when working on the documentation of Rico.

=== Documentation structure

The documentation of Rico is placed in the `documentation` subfolder of the project.
It is defined as a module by gradle and the complete documentation is written
in https://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc].

The documentation can be found in the `src/docs/asciidoc` folder of the `documentation`
module. The documentation is splitted in several `adoc` file. Whenever a new
chapter is started for the documentation a new `adoc` file should be created.
All `adoc` file are referenced in the `index.adoc` file. By doing so all
files will be rendered in one huge documenation. Including adoc files in
the index.adoc looks like shown in the following code snippet:

....
\include::project-structure.adoc[]

\include::sub-doc/subdoc.adoc[]
....

As you can see in the snippet documents can easily stored in subfolders.

=== Writing AsciiDoc based documents

A general documentation of the AsciiDoc syntax can be found
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[here].
Next to this general syntax rules we have introduced some best practices for the
Rico documentation.

==== The title of a document

Each document should start with a headline (Level 1 Section Title). So not
use a document title since the document will be included in the `index.adoc`
that defines the document title.


==== Adding images

All images are current placed in the `src/docs/asciidoc/images` folder.
An image can be added to a document just by refering the name if the image
as if it would be in the same folder as the document. The follwoing snippet
shows an example:

....
/image:example-pic.svg[]
....

You do not need to define the path to the image dir since each adoc file
contains a `ifndef` statement at the beginning that defines the location of
the image folder if it was not defined before (for example if a document is
included in another document). The `ifndef` looks like this:

....
/ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: images]
....

Instead of using pixel based images we try to use vector based images wherever
possible. Therefore all technical diagramms should be created by using
https://www.diagrams.net[diagrams.net] (sucessor of draw.io).

image:diagrams-net.png[]

As you can see in the `images` folder we store a `xml` file and a `svg` file for each
diagramm. While the `svg` is used in the AsciiDoc documents the `xml` file can be reopend
in diagrams.net. Whenever a new diagramm is created or an old diagramm is changed the
`xml` file must be updated next to the `svg` file.


=== Creating the documentation

The documentation will automatically created as a HTML based documentation
when calling the gradle `build` task. Therefore whenever you <<build-doc/build-rico.adoc,build>> the Rico
project the complete documentation will automatically be build. Next to this you can
execute the `asciidoctor` Gradle task if you onyl want to generate the documentation.
The generated documentation can be found under the `build/docs/asciidoc` folder of
the documentation module.
