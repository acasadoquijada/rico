# Grafana Dashboards for Rico

This folder contains several Grafana dashboards that can be imported to a Grafana instance or used for a Docker based setup for Grafana (as you can find in our [samples](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-samples/tree/master/metrics-sample)).

## How to import a Dashboard

TODO: add description for the import

## Provided Dashboards

We currently provide the following dashboards:

* __docker.json__ defines a dashboard that uses metrics that are provided by cadvisor for a docker environment.
* __jvm.json__ defines a dashboard that uses metrics that are provided by Rico for a Java application.
